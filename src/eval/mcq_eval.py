"""MCQ eval harness — external comparability on the BhashaBench-Legal criminal slice.

BhashaBench-Legal (bharatgenai/BhashaBench-Legal, English config, CC BY-4.0) gives a
real slice: `subject_domain == "Criminal Law & Justice"` is 1,825 MCQs, and
**579 of them cite the repealed IPC/CrPC/Evidence** — so the IPC->BNS bridge story
("answers old-code questions in the new code") gets a proper external validation set,
not a handful.

Two mismatches still need honest handling, same shape as before:

  1. Task mismatch: BhashaBench is multiple-choice; my system does generative
     criminal-law advice. So I bolt on an MCQ mode — retrieve over the BNS corpus,
     then let Flash pick whichever option the retrieved sections best support.

  2. Coverage mismatch: I only built the IPC->BNS bridge, not CrPC->BNSS or
     Evidence->BSA. Plenty of the slice is procedure/evidence/trivia my penal-code
     retrieval can't answer. So I NEVER report one bare number — always overall
     accuracy AND the old-code-cited "bridge" subset AND a no-RAG baseline, so RAG's
     actual lift is visible where it applies.

Wiring notes:
- `answer_mcq` mirrors the generator's instructor path: retrieve over BNS, feed the
  question + options + retrieved sections to Flash, force a structured single-index
  choice. Retriever + client are injectable so unit tests run at zero quota.
- `load_bhashabench_criminal_slice` filters to the criminal MCQ slice and extracts
  IPC refs from the question text for the bridge metric. `datasets` is imported lazily
  so the keyless suite doesn't need it installed.
- Everything downstream takes an already-loaded slice, so the whole harness is
  runnable/tested independent of the dataset fetch.

# (cruelty) is a DIFFERENT section from 498 and maps to a different BNS section, so it must
# survive extraction, not get stripped. `_extract_ipc_refs` normalizes the separators off.
# The trailing (?![A-Za-z]) is load-bearing: without it the optional suffix letter greedily
# grabs the first letter of the NEXT word ("302 of" -> "302O", "302 IPC" -> "302I"). A real
# suffix is a lone letter NOT followed by another letter, so "498-A came" keeps the A but
