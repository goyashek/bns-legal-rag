"""Answer generator. Pydantic-constrained cited advice via DeepSeek Pro.

Builds the LegalAdvice output from the graded chunks through `get_client("pro")`.

instructor returns citations as structured (act, section_id) pairs the
deterministic citation validator (Fri) checks exactly. The prompt forbids citing
anything outside the provided chunks; the validator enforces it, the prompt just
makes violations rare. Client is injected so tests generate with a fake at zero
quota.
