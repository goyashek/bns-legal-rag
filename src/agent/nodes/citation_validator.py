"""Deterministic citation validator.

The LLM hallucination checker (checker.py) still runs, but this sits in front of it
and is pure code, basically free on cost and latency:

  parse every [Section X, Act] the generator cited, check each one actually exists
  in the retrieved chunk set. If the answer cites BNS 307 but only 306 was retrieved,
  that citation is made up, so reject and go back to the rewriter.

This catches a confident citation to a section that was never retrieved. I'd rather
do it deterministically than trust another LLM call.

Section-level granularity: the generator legitimately cites a subsection ("318(2)")
but the corpus + retrieval are keyed at section level ("318"), so both sides are
normalized to the section before the membership test — the same trick fast_path uses
on the query side ("103(2)" -> "103"). A citation whose normalized section isn't in
the retrieved set is the real fabrication to reject.
