"""Tests for the chunking layer (stage 2: RawSection -> LegalChunk).

Tiers, same idea as test_ingest:
  - Pure-function tests (write_chunks_jsonl, _heading_summary, chunk_id shape) run
    always, no model, no PDFs, CI-safe.
  - chunk_sections tests need Chonkie + the potion-base-8M model. They run on small
    SYNTHETIC RawSections (no PDF needed) so they exercise the keep-whole-vs-split
    logic fast, and skip cleanly if Chonkie isn't importable.
  - One integration test parses the real PDFs end-to-end; skips when PDFs absent.

The behaviour I most want pinned: a section that fits the token budget stays ONE
chunk (regression guard — the semantic chunker was shattering BNS s.1 into 5 scraps),
and every chunk_id is unique and traces back to exactly one (act, section_id).
